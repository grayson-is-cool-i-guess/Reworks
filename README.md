# Reworks
Garry's Mod/Bonelab sandbox type game made for PSVita, Windows, and WebGL

# About Reworks
I made Reworks when I was in a call with my friend and thinking about a game to make for the PS Vita. We were thinking something horror-ish but I really wanted a game I could mess around in for hours without getting bored.
Thats when Reworks was born. :D

# Building Reworks
Reworks is both FREE and OPEN SOURCE! I reccomend just using the official releases but if you want to build it for other platforms or just add stuff then go ahead.
Unity versions are:
Vita: 2018.2.19f1
Windows and WebGL: The newest Unity alpha/beta

# Making Mods For Reworks
Modding will soon be supported, probably when the game actually releases.
There will most likely be a seperate Unity project and everything for making them!
